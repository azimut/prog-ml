# prog-ml

Code for the [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/titles/pplearn/programming-machine-learning/) book, redone in [futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/).

## Why?

- I want to more actively learn this.
- I want to blast my dumb algorithms against a GPU at some point.
- Book makes a special emphasis on "keeping in mind the dimensionality of the data matrices" when working throught the examples.
